Welcome to the Coding Guide! :computer: 
This guide is your key to becoming a respected coder and steering clear of those pesky coding headaches.

During your thesis, you're going to write a substantial amount of code, and keeping it organized is crucial. Your code has a future beyond your initial writing. Others (and your future self) will need to understand what you've crafted. We're here to ensure that your code tells a good story :book:, not a mystery novel :detective:.

Here's the golden rule: DON'T wait until the last week of your thesis to embark on a cleaning spree. By that point, you'll be exhausted and fully immersed in writing your manuscript. Instead, we strongly recommend maintaining your code's cleanliness and organization as you go along. Think of it as keeping your workspace tidy; it makes working much more pleasant and efficient. Trust us, you'll thank yourself later! :broom::computer:

Alright! Ready to become a coding virtuoso? :violin: Let's get started!


## Git

Git is a version control system, i.e., a tool used to track changes to your source code over time. It is crucial that you use Git for your research, starting from the very beginning of your thesis. 

You can host your git repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/), the most famous repository hosting platform. As a student, you can also benefit from the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) and obtain a Pro license for free.

You should set up a private repository as soon as possible, and add your co-supervisors to it as member.

### Git Guides

If you don't know how to use git, you should familiarize yourself with it.

You can check out this course to learn the basics:<br>

- [MIT course - Version Control (Git)](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/)

Here is a comprehensive guide from the official Git project:<br>

- [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

Finally, Atlassian (competitor of GitHub) has also a series of very nice tutorials on Git:

- [Atlassian Tutorials - Main page](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials)

- [Atlassian Tutorials - Advanced topics](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/advanced-overview)

- [Atlassian Tutorials - Git workflows (for the future; probably not needed for your thesis)](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)

Notice that most IDEs (PyCharm, VS Code, ...) provide a set of tools to easily manage your repository. Check out their documentation for more info.

### Git tips & requirements

**All the code**<br>
All your code should be tracked in your git repository.
The code in your repository should be self-contained and you should be able to use it on any machine (not just yours!). This means that your repository should contain all components necessary to make it work, or specify how to obtain them (e.g., with a `requirements.txt` file for your pip packages).

**Only the code**<br>
Complementarily, do not add to your repository any file not necessary to deploy it on a new machine. These include executables, cache files, IDE-specific config files, etc.<br>
Additionally, NEVER add the data to your repo. Do however specify how to obtain, e.g., whether it is a public dataset or a custom dataset on our servers.<br>
To make sure none of these files are ever added, your repository should always contain a `.gitignore` file, specifying which files should not be tracked. Online you can find templates for any programming language (e.g., [GitHub’s collection of .gitignore file templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore/){:target="_blank"}): you can start from any of them and customize it to your needs.
<br>
As an additional rule of thumb, you should never find yourself running `git add .`; always check which files are being added to your commits!

**Working versions**<br>
It is suggested to have a `main` branch with the last working version of your code, and a `dev` branch for each of your new implementation/refactoring. Ideally, all commits should contain a working version; this _must_ be true at least in the `main` branch.

**README file**<br>
To help others and your future self use your code, add a `README.md` file to your repo and keep it updated. It should explain (at least):

1. How to **setup** your project, including: which packages and libraries are required; how to obtain the data; how to build and run the docker image (if using docker).
2. How to **run** your project, including: what are the "main" files, what they do and how to run them; any other configuration that can be customized.

## Coding Etiquette

It goes without saying, you should always comment your code. We expect to receive a guide of your whole codebase by the end of your thesis.

Unless otherwise instructed, we encourage you to use notebooks only for visualization.

You should follow as much as possible a programming style guide (rules for writing code and make it readable). We suggest:

- **Python**: [PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).<br>(Simple guide: [How to Write Beautiful Python Code With PEP 8 – Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/))

- **C++**: [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
