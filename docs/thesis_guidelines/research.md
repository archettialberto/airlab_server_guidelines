# How to Conduct Research for Your Thesis

As a new thesis student, effectively searching research articles is crucial.
Understanding the various publication venues (workshops, conferences, and journals) will enhance the quality of your source material. 
This guide outlines the types of publications, the strategies for finding research articles, and a recommended publication pathway to help you navigate your thesis journey.

## Publication Venues

Different publication venues serve distinct purposes and stages of research. Here's a breakdown:

* :hammer: **Workshops**: Informal gatherings focused on specific topics, ideal for early-stage research and obtaining feedback.
* :speaker: **Conferences**: Formal events with rigorous peer review, suitable for presenting mature research with significant contributions.
* :newspaper: **Journals**: Periodical publications that showcase thoroughly vetted and comprehensive studies, often with high impact.

## Types of Publications

These are the most common types of publications you may encounter or consider for your research:

* **Position Papers**: Short statements expressing your viewpoint on specific issues, facilitating early discussions.
* **Poster Presentations**: Visual summaries of preliminary work, suitable for engaging with peers and receiving feedback.
* **Preprint Papers**: Early versions of research articles shared before formal peer review, often on platforms like [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).
* **Short Papers**: Concise reports on specific concepts or findings, maintaining the same standards as full papers but with limited scope.
* **Full Papers**: Comprehensive studies presenting significant research contributions, typically with stringent acceptance criteria.
* **Survey Papers**: Comprehensive reviews of existing literature, summarizing key findings and identifying research gaps.

## How to Find Research Articles

Begin by identifying key topics and research questions. Use appropriate keywords and search terms to guide your literature review. Consider the following resources:

### Research Databases

  * [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/): Specialized search engine for academic articles and publications.
  * [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/): A preprint server for physics, mathematics, computer science, and other disciplines.
  * [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/): A repository of biomedical and life sciences literature.
  * [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri?display=advanced): A comprehensive research database with a query-based search engine for journal articles (_requires PoliMI account_).

### Venue Quality Collections

  * [GGS Conference Rating](https://scie.lcc.uma.es/): Provides a comprehensive list of computer science conferences and their rankings.
  * [Scimago Journal & Country Rank](https://www.scimagojr.com/): Provides journal rankings based on Scopus data.

## Evaluating Research Articles

When selecting articles, assess their credibility and relevance:

1. Peer Review Status: Prefer peer-reviewed publications for validated and credible research.
2. Venue Prestige: Higher-ranked conferences and journals typically indicate higher quality.
3. Impact Metrics: Use Impact Factor and citation counts to gauge the influence of the work.
4. Content Quality: Ensure the research is thorough, methodologically sound, and adds novel insights to the field.

## Publication Strategy

If you want to publish your research effectively, consider the following strategy:

1. Start with Workshops: Share preliminary ideas and receive constructive feedback.
2. Progress to Conferences: Present more developed research and establish your presence in the field.
3. Consolidate in Journals: Publish comprehensive and validated studies to achieve lasting impact.

:warning: Avoid Multiple Submissions: Submit each paper to only one venue at a time and ensure originality to maintain your reputation and avoid disqualification.
